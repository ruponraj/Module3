        The Red Devils are being heavily linked with 20-year-old Atalanta
        striker Rasmus Hojlund - but just how good is he?

        Four games into qualifying, and England are all-but assured of their
        place at Euro 2024 already. The Three Lions have shaken off the
        disappointment of their World Cup quarter-final exit to make a 100
        percent start to life in what looked a tricky Group C, with Monday's 7-0
        spanking of North Macedonia yet another fine performance from Gareth
        Southgate's men.

        The England boss tends to stick with his favourites, as the likes of
        Harry Maguire, Mason Mount and Jordan Henderson continue to earn regular
        minutes despite their inconsistency at club level. That is unlikely to
        change, but competition for places will only ramp up heading into next
        year's European Championship in Germany.

        New heroes have already emerged in the form of Bukayo Saka, Jude
        Bellingham and Phil Foden, while players such as Marcus Rashford and
        Jack Grealish are now in the prime years of their careers.

        The 21-year-old was also typically dazzling on the left wing against
        Malta, and despite intense competition for places in those wide forward
        positions, the Gunners star is now surely one of the first names on the
        teamsheet for his country.

        the entire world was watching US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's
        visit to Beijing over the weekend - but perhaps none more so than the
        countries that would be on the frontlines of any conflict between the US
        and China.
